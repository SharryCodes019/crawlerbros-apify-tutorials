# Pexels Stock Media Scraper

Scrape **Pexels** — the free stock photo and video platform — without needing an API key. Search by keyword, browse the curated/popular feed, pull an entire photographer's portfolio, grab every photo and video in a curated collection, look up exact photos by ID, or find photos similar/related to a given one. Get direct, hotlink-safe image and video file URLs at multiple sizes/qualities, photographer credit and full profile stats, EXIF camera data, engagement counts, tags, dominant colors, and dimensions. No login, no cookies, no paid proxy required.

## What this actor does

- **Six modes:** `search`, `curated`, `byPhotoId`, `byUser`, `byCollection`, `similarPhotos`
- **Photos and videos:** every mode returns photos, videos, or both
- **Filters:** orientation, minimum width/height, video duration range, number of people (photo search)
- **Direct media URLs:** multiple image sizes and video file qualities, ready to download or embed
- **Photographer credit:** name, profile URL, avatar, social links, and donation link where available
- **Bonus detail data (mode=byPhotoId):** EXIF camera metadata, view/download/like counts, and the photographer's full profile stats — all bundled free with the same page fetch
- **Empty fields are omitted** — you never have to defend against `null`

## Output per photo (`recordType: "photo"`)

- `photoId`, `title`, `description`, `alt`, `slug`
- `width`, `height`, `orientation` (`landscape` / `portrait` / `square`), `aspectRatio`
- `license`, `featured` (Pexels editor's pick)
- `createdAt`, `publishedAt`
- `photographerName`, `photographerId`, `photographerUsername`, `photographerUrl`, `photographerAvatarUrl`, `photographerLocation`, `photographerInstagram`, `photographerTwitter`, `photographerIsHero`, `photographerDonateUrl`
- `tags[]`
- `imageSmallUrl`, `imageMediumUrl`, `imageLargeUrl`, `imageOriginalUrl`, `downloadUrl`
- `avgColor` (hex), `colorPalette[]` (hex)
- `collectionIds[]` — curated collections this photo belongs to (if any)
- `pageUrl`, `sourceUrl`
- `recordType: "photo"`, `scrapedAt`

### Bonus fields (mode=`byPhotoId` only — bundled free with the detail-page fetch)

- **Camera / EXIF:** `cameraMake`, `cameraModel`, `cameraIso`, `cameraAperture`, `cameraFocalLength`, `cameraShutterSpeed`, `cameraSoftware`, `photographedAt`, `fileSizeBytes`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `locationName` — present only when the photographer's upload retained this metadata
- **Engagement stats:** `viewsCount`, `downloadsCount`, `likesCount`
- **Full photographer profile:** `photographerBio`, `photographerWebsite`, `photographerYoutube`, `photographerTiktok`, `photographerFollowersCount`, `photographerFollowingsCount`, `photographerPhotosCount`, `photographerMediaCount`, `photographerPortfolioMediaCount`, `photographerCollectionsCount`, `photographerFirstUploadedOn` (also included for every record in mode=`byUser`, fetched once per run)

## Output per video (`recordType: "video"`)

- `videoId`, `title`, `description`, `slug`
- `width`, `height`, `orientation`, `aspectRatio`
- `durationSeconds`, `fps`
- `license`, `featured`
- `createdAt`, `publishedAt`
- `photographerName`, `photographerId`, `photographerUsername`, `photographerUrl`, `photographerAvatarUrl`, `photographerLocation`, `photographerInstagram`, `photographerTwitter`, `photographerIsHero`, `photographerDonateUrl`

## FAQ

**Is this affiliated with Pexels?**
No, this is an independent third-party actor that reads Pexels' public web pages. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Pexels.

**Do I need a Pexels account or API key?**
No. All modes work against Pexels' public pages with no login and no API key.

**Are the media files free to use?**
Yes — all content returned is licensed under the Pexels License (free for personal and commercial use, no attribution required), per Pexels' own terms.

**Why do some records not have `photographerLocation` or `photographerInstagram`?**
Those fields are only included when the photographer has filled them in on their Pexels profile. Empty fields are always omitted rather than returned as blank values.

**What does `peopleCount` filter, exactly?**
It filters Pexels' own photo search index by how many people appear in the photo (0, 1, or 2). It only applies to `mode=search` with `mediaType=photos`.

**Can I look up a single video by ID?**
Not currently — Pexels' individual video pages are protected more aggressively than photo pages and could not be scraped reliably (re-verified 2026-07: 5/5 test lookups still blocked with HTTP 403, versus a high success rate for photo detail pages). Videos are still fully available through `search`, `curated`, `byUser`, and `byCollection`.

**Can I filter by color or a minimum "quality" preset?**
Not currently — Pexels' `color=` and `size=` search URL parameters were re-tested (2026-07) and confirmed to have no effect on which photos are returned (the result set changes only due to normal ranking variance, identically for any parameter value, real or nonsense). Use `minWidth`/`minHeight` instead, which are enforced by this actor itself against each photo's real dimensions.

**What is `mode=similarPhotos`?**
It returns photos Pexels itself considers visually/topically similar to each photo ID you supply — the same "related photos" feed shown on a photo's own page, sourced from the same request used by `mode=byPhotoId` (no extra cost).

**Why do some `byPhotoId` records have camera/EXIF fields and others don't?**
`cameraMake`, `cameraModel`, `cameraIso`, `photographedAt`, `latitude`/`longitude`, etc. come from the photo's original file metadata. Pexels only retains this when the photographer's upload included it — many uploads have it stripped, in which case those fields are omitted entirely rather than returned empty.

**Why does `pageUrl` return an error when I open it with `curl` but works fine in my browser?**
`pageUrl`/`sourceUrl` point at Pexels' own page, which is protected by a JavaScript challenge that only real browsers can pass — it opens normally for people (and for anything that renders JavaScript), it just won't respond to a plain command-line request. All `imageXxxUrl`, `videoFiles[].url`, `thumbnailXxxUrl`, and `downloadUrl` fields are direct CDN links and work everywhere, including `curl` and server-side downloads, with no such restriction.

**How fresh is the data?**
Every run reads Pexels' live pages, so results reflect what's on the site at run time.

**How many items can I get per run?**
Up to `maxItems` (max 1000). Actual results depend on how many matches exist for your query/filters. For `mode=similarPhotos`, each input photo ID contributes up to ~12 similar photos; supply more IDs to get more results.

**Why did `mode=search` return only ~450 items even though I set `maxItems` to 1000 and Pexels shows thousands of results?**
Pexels' own search-results pagination reports a large `total_results`/`total_pages` count, but it only actually serves the first ~20 pages (~450-480 photos) of guest/anonymous search results per query — page 21 onward returns an empty result set, even though earlier pages still claimed hundreds of pages remained (re-verified 2026-07 across multiple unrelated queries). This is a hard limit on Pexels' side, not a filter or bug in this actor — once you hit it, set a narrower `searchQuery`, add `orientation`/`minWidth`/`minHeight`/`peopleCount` filters, or switch to `mode=curated`/`byUser`/`byCollection` (which paginate differently) to source more items.
