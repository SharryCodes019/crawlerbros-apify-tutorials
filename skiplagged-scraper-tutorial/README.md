# Skiplagged Flight Search Scraper

Scrape **Skiplagged** — the flight fare-comparison search engine known for surfacing hidden-city and self-transfer itineraries that other search engines don't show. Search a single route, batch many routes in one run, or feed it Skiplagged search-page URLs directly. Get real prices, airlines, flight numbers, timings, layovers, and the cheapest booking provider for every itinerary. No login, no proxy, no cookies required.

## What this actor does

- **Three modes:** `search` (single route), `byRoutes` (batch multiple routes in one run), `byUrls` (paste Skiplagged search-page links)
- **One-way and round-trip** — round-trip searches return the outbound and return legs as separate priced itineraries, each tagged with `legType`, matching how Skiplagged itself prices them
- **Passenger mix:** adults, children, and infants (lap or seated)
- **Filters:** direct-only, max stops, price range, airline allow-list, sort order
- **Booking providers:** every itinerary lists which travel site(s) currently offer its lowest price
- **Empty fields are omitted**

## Output per flight itinerary

- `flightId`, `legType` — `outbound` or `inbound`
- `originAirport`, `originCity`, `originState`, `originCountry`, `destinationAirport`, `destinationCity`, `destinationState`, `destinationCountry`
- `departureTime`, `arrivalTime` — ISO 8601 with timezone offset
- `durationMinutes`, `duration` — human-readable (e.g. `7h 30m`)
- `stops`, `direct`
- `airlines[]`, `airlineCodes[]`, `primaryAirline`
- `segments[]` — one entry per flight leg: `airlineCode`, `airlineName`, `flightNumber`, `departureAirport`, `departureTime`, `arrivalAirport`, `arrivalTime`, `durationMinutes`
- `layovers[]` — one entry per connection: `airport`, `durationMinutes`, `duration` (human-readable). Omitted on direct itineraries.
- `price`, `currency`
- `fareClass` — cabin actually returned by Skiplagged for this itinerary
- `requestedCabinClass` — the cabin class you asked for
- `adults`, `children`, `infantsLap`, `infantsSeat`
- `bookingProviders[]` — travel site(s) offering the lowest listed price
- `minRoundTripPrice` — combined round-trip total, present on `outbound` records for round-trip searches
- `sourceUrl` — the Skiplagged search-results page for this route/date
- `recordType: "skiplaggedFlight"`, `scrapedAt`

  "directOnly": true
}
```

### Example: round-trip with passenger mix and price cap

```json
{

## FAQ

**What's the data source?** Skiplagged's public flight-search results (skiplagged.com), which aggregate fares from multiple online travel agencies and airlines.

**Is this affiliated with Skiplagged?** No — this is an independent, third-party actor that reads Skiplagged's public search results. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Skiplagged.

**Why does a round-trip search return separate outbound/inbound records instead of one combined itinerary?** Skiplagged prices round-trips as two independently-booked one-way tickets (its well-known self-transfer/hidden-city model), not as a single bundled fare. Each leg is returned as its own record with `legType` set to `outbound` or `inbound`, plus `minRoundTripPrice` on the outbound record showing the combined total Skiplagged currently quotes.

**Why doesn't `cabinClass` always change the results?** Skiplagged's public search primarily returns economy inventory for most routes regardless of the requested cabin. The actor always reports the real `fareClass` Skiplagged returned alongside your `requestedCabinClass`, so you can see when the two differ.

**Why do `adults`/`children`/`infantsLap`/`infantsSeat` on output records not always match my requested passenger counts?** The `price` shown is always a real per-passenger fare, and the `adults`/`children`/etc. fields reflect exactly what Skiplagged's search response reports for that itinerary — which for its public (non-logged-in) search is typically `1 adult` regardless of the passenger counts you request. The actor never fabricates these fields; it passes your requested counts to Skiplagged and reports back only what Skiplagged's API actually returns.

**What does `bookingProviders` mean?** Skiplagged compares prices across several travel sites (airlines, OTAs, meta-search partners) for the same itinerary. This field lists whichever provider(s) are currently offering the lowest price shown.

**What are `originState`/`destinationState`?** Skiplagged reports a state or region for the queried city/metro area (e.g. `New York` for a US search, `England` for a UK search). This field is omitted when Skiplagged doesn't report one for that country.

**Can I search by city instead of a specific airport?** Yes — 3-letter metro codes like `NYC` (covers JFK/LGA/EWR) or `LON` (covers LHR/LGW/STN/LTN/LCY) are supported alongside single-airport codes like `JFK` or `LHR`.

**How fresh are the prices?** Prices reflect what Skiplagged's search API returns at the moment the actor runs — the same live pricing shown to a visitor on skiplagged.com.

**Why Skiplagged and not Skyscanner?** This actor originally targeted Skyscanner. Live testing showed every request to skyscanner.com and skyscanner.net — via both a real browser session and a plain HTTP request — was redirected 100% of the time to a hard bot-detection challenge page before any search results ever loaded, with no way to pass it without paid residential proxy infrastructure. Skiplagged is a same-category flight fare-comparison engine whose public search results are reliably accessible, so it replaces Skyscanner as this actor's data source.
